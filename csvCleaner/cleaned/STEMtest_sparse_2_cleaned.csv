Centers for Ocean Sciences Education Excellence ~,National Science Foundation,Directorate for Geosciences (GEO),"The Division of Ocean Sciences seeks to establish a network of coordinated 
centers that will facilitate collaborations and communications between ocean 
science researchers and educators. These Centers for Ocean Science Education 
Excellence (COSEE) will foster the integration of ocean research into high 
quality educational materials, allow ocean researchers to gain a better 
understanding of educational organizations and pedagogy, provide educators with 
an enhanced capacity to understand and deliver high-quality educational 
programs in the ocean sciences, and provide material to the public that will 
promote a deeper understanding of the ocean and its influence on each person's 
quality of life and our national prosperity.",2002,5.24,7.19,5.7,General STEM,,"Institutional Capacity: Support advancement and development of STEM personnel, programs, and infrastructure in educational institutions such as universities, informal education institutions, state education agencies, and local education agencies","Basic/Foundational Education Research: Research on STEM learning, teaching, or education practices/materials/technology","Disciplinary Education Research and Development: Research and development interwoven to improve STEM learning and teaching, within a single STEM discipline or across specific disciplines (e.g. learning trajectories research)",,,"Large Scale Deployment: STEM education projects, techniques, models, resources, and/or technologies implemented at the state, regional, or national scale",,,,,,,,K-12 classroom teachers,Pre-service,,Elementary (K-5),Middle (6-8),High (9-12),In-service,,Elementary (K-5),Middle (6-8),High (9-12)
