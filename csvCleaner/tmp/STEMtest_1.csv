CISE Pathways to Revitalized Undergraduate Computing Education (CPATH),National Science Foundation,Directorate for Computer & Information Science & Engineering (CISE),"Through the CISE Pathways to Revitalized Undergraduate Computing Education (CPATH) program, NSF's Directorate for Computer and Information Science and Engineering (CISE) is challenging its partners – colleges, universities and other stakeholders committed to advancing the field of computing and its impact - to transform undergraduate computing education on a national scale, to meet the challenges and opportunities of a world where computing is essential to U.S. leadership and economic competitiveness across all sectors of society. 
The CISE Pathways to Revitalized Undergraduate Education in Computing (CPATH) program  also recognizes the growing importance of CT in society.  The goals of the program are to:
•	contribute to the development of a globally competitive U.S. workforce with CT competencies essential to U.S. leadership in the global innovation enterprise;
•	increase awareness of the strategic importance of undergraduate computing education in a wide range of career fields and disciplinary and interdisciplinary areas; 
•	identify and implement integrative new models for undergraduate computing education that are replicable across a variety of programs and institutions, and have a high probability of adoption on a national scale; 
•	increase the number of students developing CT competencies by infusing CT learning opportunities into undergraduate education in the core computing fields - computer and information science and engineering, and in other fields of study; and,
•	demonstrate transformative CT-focused undergraduate education models that are replicable across a variety of institutions.
CPATH seeks to identify and define the core computing concepts, methods, technologies and tools to be integrated into promising new undergraduate education models, and to demonstrate effective strategies to develop and assess CT competencies in the relevant learning communities.  While aimed primarily at revitalizing undergraduate education, CISE encourages the exploration of new models that extend from institutions of higher education into the K-12 environment; activities that engage K-12 teachers and students to facilitate the seamless transition of secondary students into CT-focused undergraduate programs are particularly encouraged.",2007,5,5,4.37,General STEM,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Opportunities for Enhancing Diversity in the Geosciences,National Science Foundation,Directorate for Geosciences (GEO),"The Opportunities for Enhancing Diversity in the Geosciences (OEDG) Program supports proof-of-concept, dissemination, and scale-up activities aimed at
broadening participation of traditionally underrepresented or underserved communities in geoscience education and career pathways throughout the United 
States. The term 'geoscience' incorporates the Earth, Ocean, Atmospheric,and Geospace Sciences that are supported by NSF. The OEDG Program helps NSF achieve its congressional mandate to promotethe ""full development and use of the science and engineering talents of men and women, equally, of all ethnic, 
racial, and economic backgrounds"" authorized in the Science and Engineering Equal Opportunities Act of 1980. 
The OEDG Program also helps NSF address priorities articulated in the GEO Vision Report (2009) and the Transitions and Tipping Points in Complex environmental Systems report (2009) regarding the need to foster public Earth and environmental science literacy, particularly among communities and people 
that have not traditionally had access to, or engaged in, high quality educationrelated to these topics. Both reports note the urgency of developing 
an informed public that understands the scientific underpinnings of important geoscience-based topics that are increasingly relevant to policy decisions, 
national prosperity and security, and personal lives. These include issues such as global climate change, energy and fresh water resources, sustainability, and 
natural hazards. Successful development of a scientifically literate public requires consideration of the needs of diverse learner audiences and the most 
effective pedagogies for educating them through formal and informal settings.  Achieving these twin goals will require an increasingly diverse U.S. population 
to become more scientifically literate and engaged ingeoscience education and career pathways.",2002,4.57,11.79,4.18,General STEM,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The core of the activity is long-term research experiences for interdisciplinarily balanced cohorts of at least four undergraduates. Projects should focus on research at the intersection of the mathematical and biological sciences. Projects should provide students exposure to contemporary mathematics and biology, addressed with modern research tools and methods. That is, projects must be genuine research experiences rather than rehearsals of research methods. Projects must involve students from both areas in collaborative research experiences and include joint mentorship by faculty in both fields. In addition, it is expected that projects will strengthen the research and education capacity, infrastructure, and culture of the participating institutions. To this end, projects should create models for education in the mathematical and biological sciences and influence the direction of academic programs for a broad range of students.

1. To develop U.S. science, technology, and engineering expertise in ethnic and 
gender groups that are currently underrepresented in the STEM workforce;  

2. To offset financial barriers for students underrepresented in STEM fields 
pursuing a graduate education;

3. To provide hands-on research experiences at NASA Centers;  

4. To expose students to the salient aspects of professional and career 
development;
